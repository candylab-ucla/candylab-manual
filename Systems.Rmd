## Meetings

### Lab Didactics (General Lab Meetings)
Lab Didactics or General Lab Meetings are often held on a weekly basis and occur when someone would like to present their research, share topics of interest, practice for upcoming presentations, and the like. Attendance is not mandatory for all lab members; however, it is encouraged, especially if the topic being presented is of particular interest to you.

### Staff Meetings
Staff meetings are often between study coordinators and are used to discuss important updates on participant status, scheduling, payments, and other lab matters that require staff oversight and responsibility. 

### Clinical Case Meetings 
Clinical Case Meetings (CCM) are held to discuss participants' symptoms between staff and a Clinical Psychologist. CCMs are for interviewers to present a participant's symptoms and collaborate with the Clinical Psychologist on the patient's diagnoses.
